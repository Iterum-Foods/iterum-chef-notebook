  company: "",  // Optional
  role: "",  // Optional
  contactType: "waitlist",  // Identifies as waitlist contact
  source: "iterum-website",  // Where they signed up
  status: "pending",  // pending, contacted, converted, etc.
  position: 42,  // Their number in the waitlist
  createdAt: "2025-10-14T20:30:00.000Z",
