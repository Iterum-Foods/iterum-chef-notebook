**Re:** Seed Investment Opportunity - $1.5M Round

---

Dear [Investor Name],

I'm writing to share an exciting investment opportunity that sits at the intersection of two massive trends: the $899B restaurant industry's digital transformation and the growing demand for operational efficiency in professional kitchens.

## **The Problem We're Solving**

After spending 20+ years in professional kitchens, I've witnessed firsthand the chaos that poor recipe management creates across the entire culinary industry. Here's what most people don't realize:

**Restaurants are losing $2.4B+ annually** due to recipe management failures:
- 40% of restaurant failures cite inconsistent food quality as a primary factor
- The average restaurant spends $3,000+ training each new kitchen hire because recipes are scattered across notebooks, emails, and outdated systems
- Food waste increases by 15% when recipes can't be properly scaled or substitutions calculated accurately

**Catering companies struggle with event profitability** because they can't quickly and accurately:
- Scale recipes from 50 to 500 portions without errors
- Calculate true costs for accurate event bidding
- Manage complex dietary restrictions across multiple events

**Private chefs and culinary consultants** are limited in their growth because they:
- Manage recipes in spreadsheets or paper notes
- Can't efficiently serve multiple clients with different preferences
- Lack professional tools to scale their businesses beyond personal capacity

## **Our Solution: The Ultimate Recipe Library Platform**

Iterum Recipe Library is the first unified platform designed specifically for professional recipe management across the entire culinary industry. We're not building another generic business tool - we're creating the industry-standard platform for how restaurants, catering companies, private chefs, and culinary consultants manage their most valuable asset: their recipes.

### **What Makes Us Different:**

**1. Industry-Specific Design**
- Built by chefs, for chefs - we understand the real workflow challenges
- Designed for busy kitchen environments, not corporate offices
- Includes 291+ professional ingredient database with seasonality and cost tracking

**2. Comprehensive Recipe Management**
- AI-powered organization and search across thousands of recipes
- One-click scaling from 2 portions to 2,000 with automatic cost calculations
- Real-time profitability analysis and menu optimization

**3. Multi-Business Optimization**
- Restaurant chains: Standardized recipes across all locations
- Catering companies: Event-specific scaling and client preference tracking
- Private chefs: Multiple client management with dietary restriction tracking
- Consultants: White-label solutions for multiple venue management

## **The Market Opportunity**

The addressable market is enormous and growing rapidly:

**Primary SaaS Market: $8.2B**
- 660K restaurants √ó $2,400/year average = $1.58B
- 73K catering companies √ó $4,800/year = $350M  
- 180K private chefs √ó $1,200/year = $216M
- 25K culinary consultants √ó $3,600/year = $90M

**Market Drivers Creating Urgency:**

- Food inflation at 8.5% in 2024, making cost optimization critical for survival

## **Why We Will Win**

**1. First-Mover Advantage**
We're defining the category of professional recipe management. While generic tools exist, no one has built a comprehensive solution specifically for culinary professionals.

**2. Network Effects**
As more businesses join our platform:
- Ingredient pricing data becomes more accurate and valuable
- Recipe marketplace creates additional revenue opportunities
- Best practices emerge from the community, improving all users' outcomes

**3. High Switching Costs**
Once a restaurant or catering company builds their recipe library in our system, it becomes a core business asset that's difficult to migrate elsewhere.

- Target metrics: $12M ARR, 5,000+ customers by Series A

## **Exit Potential**

- Major POS and kitchen management companies

**Recent Comparable Exits:**

## **Why Now?**

Three major trends are converging to create a perfect storm of opportunity:

1. **Digital Transformation Acceleration**: COVID forced restaurants to adopt technology faster than ever
2. **Labor Crisis**: Severe staffing shortages require better training and standardization tools
3. **Economic Pressure**: Rising costs demand optimization tools for survival

**P.S.** - I'd be happy to arrange a test kitchen demonstration where you can see firsthand how our platform transforms recipe management workflows. There's nothing quite like watching a chef's reaction when they realize they can scale a recipe from 4 portions to 400 in under 30 seconds with perfect cost calculations.
