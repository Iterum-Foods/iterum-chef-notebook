## Email Template for Boston VCs

```
Subject: TikTok meets LinkedIn for 50M craftspeople (Boston founder)

Hi [Name],

I'm a Boston-based founder building Usta ‚Äî think TikTok meets 
LinkedIn for the 50M skilled workers that existing platforms 
have overlooked.

[YOUR BOSTON CONNECTION: school, company, live here, etc.]

The problem: LinkedIn doesn't work for blue-collar workers. 
We're building the first platform where craftspeople showcase 
skills through video and advance their careers.

Why [Firm]: Your investment in [Portfolio Co] aligns perfectly.

Working MVP: [demo link]
Market: 50M workers, $50B opportunity
Raising: $1.5M seed

Would love 15 min to share our deck.

Best,
[Your Name]
Boston, MA
```
