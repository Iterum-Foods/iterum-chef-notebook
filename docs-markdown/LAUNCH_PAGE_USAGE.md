## 🔐 Auth Guard Integration

### **How They Work Together:**

**launch.html:**

- Entry point for new users

**Auth Guard:**
- Protects all other pages
- Shows modal if not logged in
- Links back to launch.html
- Prevents unauthorized access

**Flow:**
```
Public pages: launch.html ✅ No auth needed
Protected pages: Everything else ✅ Auth Guard protects
```

## 🌐 Local vs Production

### **Local Development:**

http://localhost:8080/launch.html
    ↓

```

### **Production (Firebase):**
```

    ↓
Firebase rewrites to: /launch.html
    ↓
User sees login page
```

**Same result, different URLs!**
