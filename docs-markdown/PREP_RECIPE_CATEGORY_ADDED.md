## 🎨 UI Integration

The new "Prep Recipe" category integrates seamlessly with existing categories:

### Category Order
Recipe forms use this order:
1. Appetizer
2. Main Course
3. Dessert
4. Beverage
5. Sauce
6. **Prep Recipe** ← NEW

Menu forms use this order:
1. Appetizers
2. Salads
3. Soups
4. Main Courses
5. Sides
6. Desserts
7. Beverages
8. **Prep Recipes** ← NEW
9. Specials

## 📊 Backend Compatibility

The backend already supports recipe types including "prep":

```python
# app/database.py
type = Column(String, default="dish")  # dish, prep, other

# app/schemas.py
type: str = "dish"  # dish, prep, other
```

The category value `prep-recipe` will map to the backend's `type: "prep"` field.

## 🚀 Benefits

### For Chefs
- **Organization:** Clearly identify prep components vs. finished dishes
- **Efficiency:** Quickly find prep recipes needed for service
- **Planning:** Better menu and production planning
- **Training:** Easier to teach prep vs. service recipes

### For Kitchen Operations
- **Prep Lists:** Generate prep lists by category
- **Scheduling:** Schedule prep recipes separately from service
- **Inventory:** Track prep components distinctly
- **Costing:** Calculate prep costs separately
