## ❌ What If Something Goes Wrong?

### **Problem: Stuck on Login Page**

```javascript
// Open console and run:
authDiagnostics.check()

// Look for:
// - Is firebase initialized?
// - Is localStorage available?
// - Any error messages?
```

### **Problem: Redirect Loop**

```javascript
// Clear all auth data and start fresh:
authDiagnostics.clearAllAuth()

// Then reload:
location.reload()

// Try signing in again
```

### **Problem: Console Errors**

1. **Copy the error message**
2. **Run diagnostics:**
   ```javascript
   authDiagnostics.exportReport()
   ```
3. **Share the error + report**

### **Problem: Can't See Console Logs**

Make sure you're on the **Console** tab in DevTools, not Elements or Network.
