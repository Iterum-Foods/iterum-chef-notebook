## 📋 **Pre-Change Checklist:**

Before making ANY change:

### **1. Identify Impact Scope:**

### **2. Document the Change:**

- [ ] What problem are we solving?
- [ ] What is the expected behavior?
- [ ] What files will be modified?

## 🚨 **Common Missed Items:**

### **Things Often Forgotten:**

1. **Multiple Sign-In Methods:**
   - ❌ Fix sign-in, forget sign-up
   - ❌ Fix email, forget Google
   - ❌ Fix trial, forget regular
   - ✅ **Always update ALL methods**

2. **Timing Consistency:**
   - ❌ Different delays in different places
   - ✅ **Use same timing everywhere**

3. **Both Repositories:**
   - ❌ Update main app, forget landing page
   - ✅ **Check if landing page affected**

4. **Firebase Rules:**
   - ❌ Change database structure, forget rules
   - ✅ **Always update firestore.rules**

5. **Error Handling:**
   - ❌ Happy path only
   - ✅ **Add try-catch everywhere**

6. **Console Logging:**
   - ❌ Remove debugging logs
   - ✅ **Keep logs for future debugging**

7. **Mobile Testing:**
   - ❌ Desktop only
   - ✅ **Test on mobile too**
