## 🎯 **Setting Up Custom Domain: iterumfoods.xyz**

To make your site accessible at `https://iterumfoods.xyz`:

### **Step 1: Open Firebase Console**
```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/iterum-culinary-app/hosting
```

### **Step 2: Add Custom Domain**

1. Click **"Add custom domain"** button
2. Enter: `iterumfoods.xyz`
3. Click **"Continue"**

### **Step 3: Verify Domain Ownership**

Firebase will show you a TXT record to add. Example:
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: google-site-verification=ABC123XYZ (copy from Firebase)
```

**Where to add this:**
- Go to where you registered iterumfoods.xyz (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
- Find DNS settings
- Add the TXT record
- Wait 10 minutes, then click "Verify" in Firebase

### **Step 4: Configure DNS Records**

After verification, Firebase shows you DNS records to add:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 151.101.1.195

Type: A  
Name: @
Value: 151.101.65.195

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: iterum-culinary-app.web.app
```

**Add all of these in your domain registrar's DNS settings.**

### **Step 5: Wait for Propagation**

- DNS changes take 1-48 hours
- SSL certificate provisions automatically (up to 24 hours)
- Firebase will email you when ready

### **Step 6: Test Your Custom Domain**

After DNS propagates:
```
https://iterumfoods.xyz ✅
https://www.iterumfoods.xyz ✅
```

Both should work and show HTTPS (green padlock)!
