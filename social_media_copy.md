### Post 2: Educational
**Copy:**
"The Hidden Cost of Recipe Chaos 📊

Did you know the average professional kitchen loses 15-20% of potential profit to inefficient recipe management?

Here's how it adds up:

❌ Over-ordering ingredients (no accurate usage tracking)
❌ Food waste from scaling errors  
❌ Menu items priced too low (hidden costs not calculated)
❌ Staff time wasted on administrative tasks
❌ Missed seasonal pricing opportunities

What if technology could solve all of this?

✅ Real-time ingredient cost tracking
✅ Automatic recipe scaling with precision
✅ Hidden cost identification and optimization
✅ Seasonal pricing alerts and recommendations  
✅ Automated administrative workflows

That's exactly what Iterum R&D Chef Notebook does.

Our beta testers are already seeing average cost reductions of 15% in their first month.
