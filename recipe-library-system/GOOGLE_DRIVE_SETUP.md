## üìû Need Help?

**Common Questions:**

**Q: Will this use a lot of my Google Drive storage?**
A: No! Recipe Excel files are tiny (usually 50-100 KB each). 100 recipes = ~10 MB.

**Q: Can I use this with Google Workspace (work account)?**
A: Yes! Just choose "Internal" instead of "External" when setting up OAuth consent screen.

**Q: What if I already have recipes in Google Drive?**
A: Use "Sync from Google Drive" to download them into your library.

**Q: Can multiple people edit recipes at the same time?**
A: Google Drive will create versions if multiple people edit. Best practice: One person edits at a time.

**Q: Is this free?**
A: Yes! Google Drive API is free for personal use. You get 15 GB free storage with any Google account.
