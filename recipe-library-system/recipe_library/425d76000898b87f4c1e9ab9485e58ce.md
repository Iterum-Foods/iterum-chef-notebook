# Recipe and Menu Finder - Summary

## What We Built

I've created a comprehensive Python program that automatically scans folders for food recipes and menus, analyzes their content, categorizes them, and sorts them by various criteria. This program is specifically designed to work with your existing culinary app structure.

## Files Created

### Core Program Files
1. **`recipe_menu_finder.py`** - Main program with all the logic
2. **`run_recipe_finder.py`** - Simple interactive interface
3. **`find_recipes.bat`** - Windows batch file for easy execution
4. **`requirements_recipe_finder.txt`** - Python dependencies
5. **`README_Recipe_Finder.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

## Key Features

### 🔍 Smart File Detection
- Automatically identifies recipe and menu files using content analysis
- Supports multiple file formats: Excel (.xlsx, .xls), Word (.docx, .doc), PDF, text files, etc.
- Uses confidence scoring to determine how likely a file is to be a recipe

### 🏷️ Intelligent Categorization
- Distinguishes between recipes, menus, and other files
- Automatically detects cuisine types (Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Mediterranean, etc.)
- Extracts metadata like cooking time, servings, difficulty level, and tags

### 📂 Organized Output
- Sorts files by name, date, confidence score, cuisine, or category
- Creates structured folders organized by cuisine type
- Copies files to appropriate subfolders

### 📊 Comprehensive Reports
- Generates detailed JSON reports with analysis
- Exports data to CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- Provides confidence scores and categorization details

## How It Works

### 1. File Scanning
The program scans your specified folder (defaults to `Iterum App/uploads`) and looks for files with recipe-related extensions.

### 2. Content Analysis
For each file, it:
- Extracts a content preview
- Searches for recipe-related keywords
- Identifies cuisine-specific terms
- Detects cooking instructions and ingredients
- Calculates a confidence score

### 3. Categorization
Files are categorized as:
- **Recipe**: Contains ingredients and cooking instructions
- **Menu**: Contains meal planning or restaurant menus
- **Uncategorized**: Doesn't clearly fit either category

### 4. Organization
Files are organized into folders:
```
sorted_recipes/
├── recipes/
│   ├── italian/
│   ├── mediterranean/
│   ├── mexican/
│   └── ...
├── menus/
├── uncategorized/
├── recipe_analysis_report.json
└── recipe_inventory.csv
```

## Test Results

When tested with your existing `Iterum App/uploads` folder, the program found:
- **13 recipe/menu files** out of 35 total files
- **12 recipes** and **1 menu**
- Successfully categorized files by cuisine (e.g., "Butternut Hummus" → Mediterranean)
- Generated detailed reports and CSV exports

## How to Use

### Option 1: Simple Interactive Mode
```bash
python run_recipe_finder.py
```
This provides a user-friendly menu with options to sort, organize, and generate reports.

### Option 2: Command Line Interface
```bash
python recipe_menu_finder.py "path/to/folder" --output "sorted_recipes" --copy --report --csv
```

### Option 3: Windows Batch File
Double-click `find_recipes.bat` to run the program with automatic dependency checking.

## Integration with Your App

This program is designed to work seamlessly with your existing culinary app:

- **Source Integration**: Points to your existing `Iterum App/uploads` folder
- **Format Compatibility**: Works with your existing Excel recipe files
- **Data Export**: Generates reports that can be imported into your recipe database
- **Organized Output**: Creates folders that can be easily integrated into your app

## Customization Options

### Adding New Cuisines
Edit the `cuisine_types` dictionary in `recipe_menu_finder.py`:
```python
self.cuisine_types = {
    'your_cuisine': ['keyword1', 'keyword2', 'keyword3'],
    # ... existing cuisines
}
```

### Adjusting Confidence Scoring
Modify the `calculate_confidence` method to change how files are scored.

### Adding New File Formats
Update the `recipe_extensions` set and `extract_content_preview` method.

## Performance Features

- **Efficient Processing**: Handles large folders quickly
- **Memory Management**: Skips files larger than 50MB
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of corrupted or unreadable files
- **Logging**: Detailed logs for debugging and monitoring

## Future Enhancements

The program is designed to be extensible. Potential improvements include:
- Machine learning for better recipe detection
- Image analysis for recipe photos
- Integration with recipe APIs
- Web interface for file management
- Real-time folder monitoring

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_recipe_finder.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   python run_recipe_finder.py
   ```

3. **View Results**:
   Check the `sorted_recipes` folder for organized files and reports.

## Support

The program includes comprehensive error handling and logging. If you encounter issues:
1. Check the `recipe_finder.log` file for detailed information
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure you have read/write permissions for the folders
4. Test with a small folder first
