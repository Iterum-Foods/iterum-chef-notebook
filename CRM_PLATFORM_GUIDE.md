        const token = await authenticateAdmin();
        
        // Fetch waitlist

            headers: {
                'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
            }
        });
        
        const data = await response.json();
        
        data.entries.forEach(entry => {
            if (!allContacts.find(c => c.email === entry.email)) {
                allContacts.push({
                    ...entry,
                    contactType: CONTACT_TYPES.WAITLIST,
                    status: entry.status
                });
            }
        });
        
        console.log('✅ Loaded', data.total, 'waitlist contacts from API');
    } catch (e) {
        console.error('Error loading waitlist from API:', e);
        // Fallback to localStorage

## 📧 Email Integration

### **Current Email Actions:**

### **Future Email Enhancements:**

You can integrate with email services:

## 🔐 Security & Access

### **Admin Access:**

Both platforms are **admin-only** and should be:

1. **Protected by authentication**
   - Add auth_guard.js to both pages
   - Require admin role check
   - Implement admin login page

2. **Not publicly accessible**
   - Keep URLs private
   - Add to `.gitignore` for sensitive configs
   - Use environment variables for API keys

### **Current Admin Credentials (Waitlist API):**

```python
ADMIN_USERNAME = "admin"
ADMIN_PASSWORD = "iterum2025!"  # Change in production!
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Change this password in production!
