## 2. The Problem

### For Professionals:
1. **No easy way to showcase skills** - LinkedIn = text, Instagram = not professional
2. **Portfolio creation is hard** - What to create? How to film? Is it good enough?
3. **Can't prove abilities** - Resumes don't demonstrate actual skills
4. **Fragmented presence** - Skills scattered across platforms
5. **Weak professional network** - LinkedIn is generic, not industry-specific
6. **No daily practice system** - Hard to stay sharp and improve

### For Employers:
1. **Can't assess real skills** - Resumes show claims, not proof
2. **Expensive recruitment** - $3-5K per hire, 45+ days to fill
3. **High turnover** - 73% leave in first year (skill mismatch)
4. **Time-consuming** - Review hundreds of resumes manually
5. **No skill verification** - Can't trust claimed abilities

### Market Gap:
**$12B spent annually** on recruitment, training, and professional networking across skilled industries‚Äîwith no platform that combines:
- Easy portfolio creation (TikTok ease)
- Social networking (Instagram engagement)
- Professional validation (LinkedIn credibility)
- Expert learning (Masterclass depth)
- Daily practice (Duolingo consistency)
