### Speaker Notes
"Usta—Turkish for 'master craftsman'—is revolutionizing how professionals build and showcase their skills. Think TikTok meets LinkedIn, but for learning and proving real professional abilities."

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM 😰

### Visual
- Split screen or 2 columns
- Icons for each pain point
- Frustrated professional imagery

### Content
```
The Problem: Skill Building is Broken

For Learners:
❌ Don't know what to create for portfolio
❌ No way to prove skills (resumes don't show ability)
❌ LinkedIn is generic, Instagram isn't professional
❌ Platforms are either social OR professional, not both

For Employers:
❌ Can't assess real skills from resumes
❌ $3-5K cost per hire
❌ 73% first-year turnover
❌ 45 days average time-to-hire

$3.2B spent annually on recruitment & training
—with no platform that validates real skills
```

### Speaker Notes
"There's a massive gap in the market. Professionals struggle to showcase their actual abilities, and employers can't assess real skills. The current solutions—LinkedIn, Instagram, job boards—each solve only part of the problem."
