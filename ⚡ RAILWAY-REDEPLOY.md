# ⚡ Force Railway to Redeploy Latest Code

## Railway is using an old cached build. Let's fix it!

---

## Option 1: Redeploy from Dashboard (EASIEST) ⭐

### Steps:

1. **Go to your Railway project**
   - https://railway.app/dashboard

2. **Click on your backend service**

3. **Go to "Deployments" tab**

4. **Find the latest deployment** (should show "Failed")

5. **Click the "..." menu (three dots)** on the right

6. **Select "Redeploy"**

7. Railway will rebuild using the latest code from GitHub!

✅ **This should work!**

---

## Option 2: Trigger via Settings

1. **Click on your backend service**

2. **Go to "Settings" tab**

3. **Scroll to "Service"** section

4. **Click "Redeploy"** button

5. Railway fetches latest from GitHub and rebuilds!

---

## Option 3: Make a Dummy Commit (if above don't work)

If Railway still won't pick up changes:

**Run this in PowerShell:**

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\chefm\Iterum Innovation\Skills App"
echo "# Railway deployment" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger Railway rebuild"
git push
```

This forces a new commit, which Railway will detect automatically.

## ✅ What Should Happen

After redeploying, you should see:

```
[1/6] FROM python:3.11-slim
[2/6] WORKDIR /app
[3/6] RUN apt-get update...
[4/6] COPY requirements-usta.txt ./requirements-usta.txt  ← Fixed!
[5/6] RUN pip install...
[6/6] COPY . .
✓ Build completed successfully
```

---

## 🐛 If Still Failing

Railway might be confused about which branch to use.

**Check this:**

1. In Railway → Backend Service → **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Source"** section
3. Verify:
   - **Repository:** chefmatt2024/usta-backend ✅
   - **Branch:** main ✅
   - **Root Directory:** / (empty or root)

If branch is wrong, change it to `main` and save.

## 💡 Why This Happened

Railway sometimes caches the repository state. The Dockerfile fix was pushed to GitHub, but Railway's build cache didn't refresh.

Redeploying forces it to fetch the latest code.

## 🚀 Try Option 1 First!

Go to Railway → Deployments → Click "..." → "Redeploy"

**Let me know when the build starts again!**
