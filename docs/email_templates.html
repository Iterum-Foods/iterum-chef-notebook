            <p>Hi again!</p>
            
            <p>Last week, I was talking to Chef Sarah from a 200-seat restaurant in Chicago. She told me something that stopped me in my tracks:</p>
            
            <p><em>"I spend more time managing spreadsheets than I do creating new dishes. There has to be a better way."</em></p>
            
            <p>That conversation reminded me exactly why we're building Iterum R&D.</p>
