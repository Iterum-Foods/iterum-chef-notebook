## 🎯 Updated Pitch for Investors

### **New Angle:**
```
"We're building Duolingo meets Instagram—for skilled craftspeople.

Problem: 50M people learning welding, coding, cooking, etc.—mostly alone. 
YouTube is passive. Classes are expensive. No community support.

Solution: Usta gives them:
• Master craftsmen as mentors (Masterclass-style)
• Guided daily practice (Duolingo-style)
• Community validation (Instagram-style)
• Clear progression (Gaming-style)

Users come to learn. Stay for community. Build portfolios.
Jobs happen naturally when you're skilled.

Revenue: Premium features, learning courses, master subscriptions
(Job board later as bonus revenue stream)

Market: 50M skilled workers wanting to improve
Retention: Community + daily practice = sticky
Growth: Invite friends to learn together = viral

This is about skill mastery and community.
Career benefits are the cherry on top."
```
