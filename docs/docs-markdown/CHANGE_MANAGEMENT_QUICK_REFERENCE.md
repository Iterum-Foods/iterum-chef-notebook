# ðŸš€ **Change Management Quick Reference**

## **âš¡ Quick Change Process**

### **1. Before Making Changes**
- [ ] **Assess Impact**: What components will be affected?
- [ ] **Plan Rollback**: How can I quickly revert if needed?
- [ ] **Create Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/change-name`
- [ ] **Backup Data**: If changing database or critical files

### **2. During Development**
- [ ] **Follow Standards**: Use ESLint, Prettier, write tests
- [ ] **Test Locally**: Validate changes work as expected
- [ ] **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation
- [ ] **Commit Frequently**: Small, focused commits with clear messages

### **3. Before Deployment**
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test with related components
- [ ] **User Testing**: Validate UX and functionality
- [ ] **Performance Check**: Ensure no performance impact
- [ ] **Security Review**: No vulnerabilities introduced

### **4. Deployment & Monitoring**
- [ ] **Staged Rollout**: Deploy to subset first if possible
- [ ] **Monitor Closely**: Watch for issues in production
- [ ] **Full Rollout**: Deploy to all users if no issues
- [ ] **Post-Deployment**: Monitor for unexpected issues

## **ðŸ”§ Essential Commands**

### **Git Workflow**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/change-description

# Make changes and test
npm run test
npm run lint

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "feat: add user selection requirement

- Enforce user selection before app initialization
- Integrate with startup loading manager
- Add event-driven app ready system"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/change-description
```

### **Quick Rollback**
```bash
# Revert last commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Revert specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Reset to previous state (DANGEROUS - use with caution)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force origin main
```

## **ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist**

### **Functionality**

1. **STOP**: Don't make more changes
2. **ASSESS**: Evaluate severity and scope
3. **ROLLBACK**: Revert to last known good version
4. **COMMUNICATE**: Notify stakeholders
5. **INVESTIGATE**: Find root cause
6. **FIX**: Develop and test the fix
7. **REDEPLOY**: Deploy fix with extra caution

### **Quick Emergency Commands**
