# State Persistence Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Task Complete

**Goal:** Ensure user information and project selection persist consistently when navigating between pages.

## 🎯 What Was Done

### 1. Created State Persistence Manager
**File:** `assets/js/state-persistence-manager.js`

A comprehensive system that:
- ✅ Persists **user state** across all pages
- ✅ Persists **project selection** across all pages
- ✅ Synchronizes state across browser tabs
- ✅ Handles page navigation automatically
- ✅ Verifies state consistency every 5 seconds
- ✅ Auto-recovers from any inconsistencies

### 2. Updated All Major Pages

Added the State Persistence Manager to **10 pages**:

1. ✅ `index.html` - Main Dashboard
2. ✅ `ingredients.html` - Ingredients
3. ✅ `recipe-library.html` - Recipe Library
4. ✅ `recipe-upload.html` - Recipe Upload
5. ✅ `equipment-management.html` - Equipment
6. ✅ `menu-builder.html` - Menu Builder
7. ✅ `vendor-management.html` - Vendors
8. ✅ `vendor-price-comparison.html` - Price Comparison
9. ✅ `inventory.html` - Inventory
10. ✅ `production-planning.html` - Production Planning

## 🔑 Key Features

### User Persistence
- ✅ User name displays consistently on all pages
- ✅ User email persists across navigation
- ✅ User avatar/initial shows correctly
- ✅ Session state maintained
- ✅ Works after browser refresh

### Project Persistence
- ✅ Selected project persists across all pages
- ✅ Project name displays in header
- ✅ Project dropdown shows correct selection
- ✅ User-specific project storage (each user has their own project selection)
- ✅ Master project as default

### Cross-Tab Synchronization
- ✅ Changes in one tab update other tabs
- ✅ Prevents state conflicts
- ✅ Automatic sync without refresh

### Smart Recovery
- ✅ Detects inconsistencies automatically
- ✅ Fixes mismatches in real-time
- ✅ Handles missing data gracefully
- ✅ Periodic verification (every 5 seconds)

## 🎮 How to Use

### For Users
No action needed! Everything works automatically:
1. Sign in → User info persists everywhere
2. Select a project → Selection persists everywhere
3. Navigate between pages → State remains consistent
4. Open multiple tabs → State syncs across tabs

### For Developers

#### Check Current State
```javascript
// View current state summary
window.getStateStatus();
```

#### Force Refresh State
```javascript
// Force refresh if needed
window.refreshUserAndProjectState();
```

#### Manual Sync
```javascript
// Manually sync all elements
window.statePersistenceManager.syncAllPageElements();
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### On Page Load
1. State Persistence Manager initializes
2. Loads user from localStorage
3. Loads project (user-specific) from localStorage
4. Updates all UI elements
5. Sets up event listeners

### During Navigation
1. Saves state before leaving page
2. Restores state on new page
3. Syncs all display elements
4. Verifies consistency

### Across Tabs
1. Detects storage changes in other tabs
2. Loads updated state
3. Syncs UI elements automatically

## 📦 Storage Structure

### User Keys
```
current_user          → Full user object
current_user_id       → Quick access ID
session_active        → Session flag
```

### Project Keys (Per User)
```
iterum_current_project_user_<userId>  → Current project
iterum_projects_user_<userId>         → All projects
```
