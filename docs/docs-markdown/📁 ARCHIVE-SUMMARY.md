```

### **After (Clean):**
```
✅ Single active landing page system
✅ Separate Skills App folder (makes sense - different product)
✅ All old files archived together
✅ Clear, organized structure
✅ Easy to find current vs old
```

   ```

2. **List contents:**
   ```
   dir
   ```

3. **Open any archived file:**
