## 🔥 Firebase Deployment - Steps to Complete

### **You Need to Run (Manual Steps):**

Firebase requires **interactive login** which needs a browser window. Here's how:

---

### **Step 1: Re-authenticate with Firebase**

Open a **NEW** Command Prompt or PowerShell (not in VS Code) and run:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\chefm\my-culinary-app\Iterum App"
firebase login --reauth
```

**What happens:**
1. Browser window opens
2. Select your Google account
3. Click "Allow" to authorize Firebase
4. Browser shows "Success!"
5. Terminal shows "✔ Success! Logged in as your@email.com"

---

### **Step 2: Deploy to Firebase**

In the same terminal, run:

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Or use the batch file:**
```bash
deploy_to_firebase.bat
```

**Expected output:**
```
=== Deploying to 'iterum-culinary-app'...

✔ hosting: 150 files uploaded successfully

✔ Deploy complete!

Hosting URL: https://iterum-culinary-app.web.app
```

---

### **Step 3: Test Live Site**

1. Open in **incognito mode:**
   ```
   https://iterum-culinary-app.web.app
   ```

2. **Sign in** with your credentials

3. **Check these:**
   - ✅ User name appears top-right
   - ✅ Can navigate between pages
   - ✅ Design looks modern and consistent
   - ✅ Sign-out works

4. **Open console (F12):**
   ```javascript
   authDiagnostics.check()
   // Should show all green
   ```

---

## 🔧 If Firebase Login Fails

### **Option 1: Try in Regular Terminal**

Don't use VS Code's integrated terminal. Instead:

1. Press **Windows Key**
2. Type "PowerShell"
3. Right-click → "Run as Administrator"
4. Navigate to project:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\chefm\my-culinary-app\Iterum App"
   ```
5. Run:
   ```bash
   firebase login --reauth
   ```

---

### **Option 2: Clear Firebase Credentials**

```bash
firebase logout
firebase login
```

---

### **Option 3: Use CI Token (Advanced)**

If interactive login doesn't work:

```bash
firebase login:ci
```

This generates a token you can use for automated deployments.
