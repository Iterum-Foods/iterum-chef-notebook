# 🧠 Smart Menu Parser - AI-Like Pattern Recognition

## Problem Solved
The menu import function was not detecting menu items well. The old parser was too rigid and only looked for specific patterns.

---

## ❌ Old Parser Issues

### What Was Wrong:
```javascript
// OLD: Only recognized 3 bullet types
if (line.startsWith('-') || line.startsWith('•') || line.startsWith('*'))

// OLD: Only one price format
const priceMatch = text.match(/\$(\d+(?:\.\d{2})?)/);

// OLD: Only `:` for categories
if (line.endsWith(':'))

// OLD: Only ` - ` for descriptions
if (cleanText.includes(' - '))
```

### Problems:
- ❌ Missed items without bullets
- ❌ Missed prices in other formats (£12.50, €15, ¥1200)
- ❌ Missed category headers in other formats
- ❌ Couldn't handle multi-line descriptions
- ❌ Weak at detecting what's an item vs description
- ❌ Poor categorization

---

## ✅ New Smart Parser Features

### 1. **Multi-Format Price Detection**
Recognizes 10+ price formats:
```
✅ $12.50      - US Dollar
✅ £12.50      - British Pound
✅ €12.50      - Euro
✅ ¥1,200      - Yen
✅ ₹350        - Rupee
✅ 12.50 USD   - Text format
✅ 12 dollars  - Written out
✅ 12,000 won  - Korean Won
✅ $12         - No cents
```

### 2. **Smart Category Header Detection**
Multiple patterns recognized:
```
✅ APPETIZERS:             - Colon format
✅ ### APPETIZERS          - Markdown
✅ --- APPETIZERS ---      - Dashes
✅ ** APPETIZERS **        - Bold
✅ [APPETIZERS]            - Brackets
✅ == APPETIZERS ==        - Equals
✅ <APPETIZERS>            - Angle brackets
✅ ALL CAPS TEXT           - Pure caps
✅ • APPETIZERS            - Bullet caps
```

### 3. **Intelligent Item Detection**
Knows what's a menu item even without explicit markers:

**Heuristics:**
- ✅ Has a price → Likely an item
- ✅ Starts with bullet/dash → Likely an item
- ✅ Short line before descriptive text → Likely a title
- ✅ Contains food keywords → Likely an item
- ✅ Line before a price → Likely item name

**Food Keywords:**
```
grilled, fried, baked, roasted, sautéed, braised, steamed,
fresh, organic, homemade, signature,
chicken, beef, pork, fish, salmon, shrimp,
pasta, rice, salad, soup, sandwich, burger
```

### 4. **Multi-Line Descriptions**
Understands descriptions that span multiple lines:
```
Grilled Salmon $28
  Served with lemon butter sauce
  Accompanied by seasonal vegetables
  Chef's signature preparation

Result:
Name: "Grilled Salmon"
Price: $28.00
Description: "Served with lemon butter sauce Accompanied by seasonal vegetables Chef's signature preparation"
```

### 5. **Description Detection**
Knows what looks like a description:
```
✅ Starts with: "served", "with", "topped", "includes"
✅ Starts with lowercase (continuation)
✅ No price present
✅ No bullet point
✅ Reasonable length (10-200 chars)
```

### 6. **Smart Auto-Categorization**
11 built-in category rules with keyword matching:
```
Appetizers       → appetizer, starter, tapas, wings, nachos
Soups & Salads   → soup, salad, chowder, caesar
Pasta & Noodles  → pasta, spaghetti, noodle, ramen
Seafood          → fish, salmon, tuna, shrimp, scallop
Beef & Burgers   → beef, steak, burger, ribeye
Poultry          → chicken, turkey, duck
Pork & Lamb      → pork, lamb, ribs, bacon
Pizza            → pizza, flatbread
Sandwiches       → sandwich, wrap, panini
Desserts         → dessert, cake, pie, ice cream, chocolate
Beverages        → drink, cocktail, wine, beer, coffee
```

### 7. **Dietary Info Extraction**
Automatic detection of dietary information:
```
✅ Vegetarian    - (V), vegetarian, veggie
✅ Vegan         - (VG), vegan
✅ Gluten-Free   - (GF), gluten-free
✅ Dairy-Free    - (DF), dairy-free
✅ Nut-Free      - (NF), nut-free
✅ Keto          - keto, ketogenic
✅ Paleo         - paleo
✅ Low-Carb      - low-carb
```

### 8. **Allergen Detection**
Identifies common allergens:
```
✅ Dairy      → milk, cheese, cream, butter
✅ Nuts       → nuts, almond, walnut, peanut
✅ Shellfish  → shrimp, lobster, crab, oyster
✅ Fish       → salmon, tuna, cod, halibut
✅ Eggs       → egg, eggs
✅ Soy        → soy, tofu, edamame
✅ Wheat      → wheat, flour, bread, pasta
✅ Gluten     → gluten, barley, rye
```
