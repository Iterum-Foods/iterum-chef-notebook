Subject: TikTok meets LinkedIn for 50M craftspeople (Boston founder)

Hi [Name],

I'm a Boston-based founder building Usta ‚Äî think TikTok meets 
LinkedIn for the 50M skilled workers (plumbers, welders, chefs) 
that existing platforms have overlooked.

Boston connection: [Your Boston tie - school, previous company, 
local to area]

The problem: LinkedIn doesn't work for blue-collar workers. 
Instagram isn't professional. We're building the first platform 
where craftspeople can showcase skills through video, get validated 
by peers, and advance their careers.

Why [Firm Name]: Your investment in [Portfolio Company] and focus 
on [Their Thesis] aligns perfectly with what we're building.

Early progress:
- Working MVP (live demo: [link])
- 50M target market
- Clear monetization
- Based in Boston

Raising $1.5M seed. Would love 15 min to share our deck.

Best,
[Your Name]

Boston, MA
[Your connection to Boston]
```
