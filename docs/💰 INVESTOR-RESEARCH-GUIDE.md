## 📝 Investor Email Template

### **Subject Lines (Test These):**
- "TikTok meets LinkedIn for 50M skilled workers"
- "Raised by [Mutual Connection] - Professional skills platform"
- "Seeking $1.5M to build LinkedIn for craftspeople"

### **Email Template:**

```
Hi [Investor Name],

[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out / I've been following 
your work in [sector] and your investment in [portfolio company].

I'm building Usta — think TikTok meets LinkedIn for the 50M skilled 
professionals LinkedIn forgot (plumbers, welders, chefs, etc).

The problem: These workers have no platform to showcase skills, 
find jobs, or learn from experts. LinkedIn doesn't work for them. 
Instagram isn't professional. YouTube is passive.

Our solution: TikTok-style video feed + LinkedIn value prop + 
Duolingo gamification. Record skills, get validated by peers, 
level up your career.

Early metrics:
- Working MVP (live at [link])
- Targeting 50M US skilled workers
- $50B+ market (training + recruitment)
- Clear path to $42M Year 5 revenue

We're raising $1.5M seed to:
1. Launch beta with 5 craft communities
2. Hire 2 engineers + 1 community manager  
3. Reach 100K users in 12 months

I'd love 15 minutes to share our deck and get your thoughts.

Available for a call next week?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Live demo: [link to demo]
Deck: [link to pitch deck]
