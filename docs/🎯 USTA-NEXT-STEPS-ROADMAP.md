## 🎯 My Recommendation: Quick MVP

Start with **Path 1** because:

1. **Validate fast** - Know if people want it
2. **Learn real needs** - Users tell you what to build
3. **Build momentum** - Real users = traction
4. **Less risk** - Don't build the wrong thing

**You already have 70% of MVP built!**
