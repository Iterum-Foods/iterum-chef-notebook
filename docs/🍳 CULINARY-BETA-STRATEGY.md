# 🍳 Usta Culinary Beta - Strategy

## 🎯 Why Start with Chefs/Cooks?

**Perfect first community because:**
- ✅ You know the market (culinary background)
- ✅ Visual skills (cooking looks great on video)
- ✅ Clear skill progression (prep → line cook → sous → chef)
- ✅ Strong community culture (chefs help chefs)
- ✅ Existing network (your culinary connections)
- ✅ High engagement potential (passionate about craft)

## 🎯 Beta Focus: Culinary Professionals
