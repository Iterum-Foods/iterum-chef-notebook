# 📋 Waitlist System - Complete Picture

## ✅ **You Have TWO Waitlist Systems!**

### **Clarification:**

You actually have **TWO separate waitlist implementations**:

---

## 1️⃣ **Separate Waitlist Repository** (Active!)

### **Repository:**
```
Iterum-Foods/chef-ready-waitlist
https://github.com/Iterum-Foods/chef-ready-waitlist
```

**Status:** ✅ **This is your ACTIVE waitlist system!**

### **What This Is:**
- Dedicated GitHub repository for waitlist management
- Separate from your main app
- Likely has its own deployment
- Stores waitlist data independently

### **Purpose:**
- Public landing page for Chef Ready
- Waitlist signup for people interested in your app
- Collects emails before full launch
- Separate brand/product positioning

### **Likely Contains:**
- Landing page HTML/CSS
- Waitlist signup form
- Backend API (Node.js/Python/other)
- Database configuration
- Deployment scripts

---

## 2️⃣ **Waitlist in Main App** (Local/Inactive)

### **Repository:**
```
Iterum-Foods/iterum-chef-notebook
(Your current repo)
```

**Status:** ⚠️ **Local only - not deployed**

### **What This Is:**
- Waitlist code IN your main app repo
- Files: `landing_page.html`, `waitlist_admin.html`, `waitlist.db`
- Backend: `app/routers/waitlist.py`
- Database: Local SQLite (24 KB)

### **Purpose:**
- Secondary/backup waitlist system
- Or old implementation
- Or testing/development version

---

## 🎯 **Which One Should You Use?**

### **Use: `chef-ready-waitlist` Repository** ✅

**This is your production waitlist!**

**Why:**
- ✅ Separate, dedicated system
- ✅ Likely already deployed
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Easier to manage independently
- ✅ Can have different branding

### **The one in your main app:**
- ⚪ Keep as backup
- ⚪ Or remove if not needed
- ⚪ Or use for different purpose
