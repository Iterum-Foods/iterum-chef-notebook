# 🔍 Verify Waitlist Backend Connection

**Issue:** Waitlist doesn't seem to be saving/loading to backend  
**Let's verify step by step**

---

## 📊 **Check 1: Firestore Database Exists**

### **Open Firebase Console:**

```
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/iterum-culinary-app/firestore
```

### **What to Look For:**

1. **Is Firestore enabled?**
   - Should see "Cloud Firestore" section
   - Should NOT see "Get started" button
   - Should see database interface

2. **Does 'contacts' collection exist?**
   - Look in left sidebar
   - Should see "contacts" collection
   - Click on it

3. **Are there any documents?**
   - If you've tested waitlist signup
   - Should see documents with email addresses
   - Each document should have fields: email, contactType, position, etc.

**Screenshot what you see and tell me!**

## 📊 **Check 2: Waitlist Signup Working**

### **Test Waitlist Signup:**

1. **Visit landing page:**
   ```
   https://iterum-landing.web.app
   ```

2. **Open console** (`F12`)

3. **Enter test email** in waitlist form

4. **Click submit**

5. **Watch console for:**
   ```
   🔥 Firebase initialized - Waitlist ready!
   📝 Adding to waitlist: test@example.com
   ✅ Successfully added to waitlist! Position: X
   ```

6. **Check for errors:**
   - ❌ "Missing or insufficient permissions" = Rules issue
   - ❌ "Firebase not initialized" = Config issue
   - ✅ Success message = Working!

---

## 📊 **Check 3: Data in Firestore**

### **After Successful Signup:**

1. **Go to Firestore Console:**
   ```
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/iterum-culinary-app/firestore
   ```

2. **Click "contacts" collection**

3. **Look for your test email**
   - Should see a document
   - Document ID: Auto-generated
   - Fields should include:
     - email: "test@example.com"
     - contactType: "waitlist"
     - source: "landing-page"
     - position: (number)
     - createdAt: (timestamp)
     - status: "pending"

**If you see this = Waitlist IS saving to backend!** ✅

---

## 📊 **Check 4: CRM Loading from Firestore**

### **Test CRM:**

1. **Visit CRM:**
   ```
   https://iterum-culinary-app.web.app/contact_management.html
   ```

2. **Open console** (`F12`)

3. **Watch for:**
   ```
   📊 Loading contacts from all sources...
   📋 Loading waitlist from Firestore...
   ✅ Loaded X waitlist contacts from Firestore
   ```

4. **Click "Waitlist" tab**

5. **Should see:**
   - Your test email
   - Position number
   - Source: "landing-page"
   - Status badge

**If you see contacts = CRM IS loading from backend!** ✅

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Problem: No 'contacts' collection in Firestore**

**Cause:** No waitlist signups have succeeded yet

**Fix:**
1. Check Firestore rules are deployed
2. Test waitlist signup with console open
3. Look for permission errors

### **Problem: Waitlist signup shows permission error**

**Cause:** Firestore rules not deployed or wrong

**Fix:**
```bash
cd "C:\Users\chefm\my-culinary-app\Iterum App"
firebase deploy --only "firestore:rules"
```

### **Problem: CRM shows "0" waitlist contacts**

**Possible causes:**
1. No signups yet (test from landing page)
2. CRM not querying correctly
3. Firestore rules blocking reads

**Check console in CRM for:**
- "📋 Loading waitlist from Firestore..."
- Any errors?

### **Problem: Waitlist signup succeeds but doesn't show in CRM**

**Cause:** Different collection name or query issue

**Check:**
1. Firestore Console - what collection name?
2. Landing page code - saves to "contacts"?
3. CRM code - queries "contacts"?

---

## 🔍 **Manual Verification:**

### **Check Firestore Rules:**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\chefm\my-culinary-app\Iterum App"
firebase firestore:rules
```

**Should show:**
```javascript
match /contacts/{contactId} {
  allow create: if request.resource.data.contactType == 'waitlist'...
  allow read: if true;
}
```

### **Check What's Deployed:**

```bash
firebase hosting:channel:list
```

**Should show:**
- Main app: Recent deploy time
- Landing: Recent deploy time
