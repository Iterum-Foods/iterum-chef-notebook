# ðŸ”¨ USTA - Executive Summary

**Raising $1.5M Seed | $8M Pre-Money Valuation | October 2025**

---

## One-Sentence Pitch

Usta is TikTok for professional skillsâ€”making skill building as easy as following a trend, while creating validated portfolios that help users land better jobs.

---

## The Problem ($3.2B Market Pain)

**For 50M+ skilled professionals:**
- No way to prove abilities (resumes don't show skill)
- Don't know what to create for portfolios
- LinkedIn is generic, Instagram isn't professional

**For employers:**
- Can't assess real skills from resumes
- $3-5K cost per hire, 73% first-year turnover
- 45 days average time-to-hire

**Result:** $3.2B spent annually on recruitment with no platform that validates real skills.

---

## The Solution

Usta combines TikTok's ease, LinkedIn's professional validation, Masterclass's expert learning, Duolingo's gamification, and Instagram's social features into ONE platform.

**How it works:**
1. **Master Usta** (top professional) creates skill challenge with recording guide
2. **User** follows the guided template (no creative pressure!)
3. **Records** their version using step-by-step camera guides
4. **Gets validated** by other professionals
5. **Builds portfolio** automatically with each challenge

**Result:** Professional skill building as easy as TikTok, as valuable as LinkedIn.
