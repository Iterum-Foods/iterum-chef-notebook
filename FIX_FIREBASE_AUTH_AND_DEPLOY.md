# 🔧 Fix Firebase Authentication & Deploy

**Issue:** Firebase credentials expired - deployment failed  
**Solution:** Reauthenticate and redeploy

---

## 🚨 **Quick Fix Steps:**

### **Step 1: Open a New Terminal**

Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** (NOT through Cursor):

- Press `Windows Key`
- Type "PowerShell"
- Click "Windows PowerShell"

### **Step 2: Reauthenticate with Firebase**

In the new terminal, run:

```bash
firebase login --reauth
```

**What happens:**
- Opens browser
- Login to your Google account (same one as Firebase Console)
- Grant permissions
- Terminal shows: "✔ Success! Logged in as [your-email]"

### **Step 3: Deploy Main App**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\chefm\my-culinary-app\Iterum App"
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Should show:**
```
✔ Deploy complete!
Hosting URL: https://iterum-culinary-app.web.app
```

### **Step 4: Deploy Landing Page**

```bash
cd "C:\Users\chefm\my-culinary-app\Iterumwebsite"
firebase deploy --only hosting:landing
```

**Should show:**
```
✔ Deploy complete!
Hosting URL: https://iterum-landing.web.app
```

### **Step 5: Test**

Visit and test:
- `https://iterum-culinary-app.web.app/launch.html`
- Look for syntax errors in console
- Should be gone now!

## ✅ **What Will Be Fixed:**

After deployment:

✅ **No more "Unexpected token 'export'" error**  
✅ **Firebase config loads properly**  
✅ **Firestore initialization won't throw errors**  
✅ **Sign-up/Sign-in will work**  
✅ **No redirect loops**

## 📋 **All Code Changes (Already Done):**

These are committed to GitHub, just need deployment:

✅ Fixed firebase-config.js export syntax  
✅ Fixed firestore-sync.js initialization  
✅ Fixed all sign-in/sign-up timing  
✅ Added 100ms localStorage write delays  
✅ Added verification before redirects

**Everything is ready in GitHub, just needs Firebase deployment!**

## 🎯 **After Deployment:**

### **Test These:**

1. **Sign-Up** - Create new account
2. **Sign-In** - Login with existing account
3. **No Console Errors** - Check for red errors
4. **No Redirect Loop** - Should stay in app
5. **Waitlist** - Test from landing page
